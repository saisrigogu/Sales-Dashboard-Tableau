**Sales Performance Dashboard – Tableau Project**

**Project Summary**

This project involves analyzing historical sales data and building an interactive Sales Performance Dashboard using Tableau to derive meaningful business insights.
The dashboard evaluates overall sales performance, profitability, sales volume, regional trends, segment contribution, and customer impact.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis and data visualization skills applied to real-world sales data, with a focus on business decision support.

**Project Objective**

The primary objectives of this project are:
To understand overall sales, profit, and quantity performance
To compare year-over-year trends across key metrics
To identify high- and low-performing states and regions
To analyze monthly sales trends and seasonality
To evaluate segment-wise and regional contribution to total sales
To identify top-contributing customers and regions
These objectives align with common business requirements in sales performance and operational analysis.

**Dataset Description**

The dataset contains historical sales transaction data with fields related to:
Order and date information
Sales, profit, and quantity measures
Geographic attributes (state and region)
Customer and segment details
The data is structured and prepared for analysis within Tableau.

**Tools and Technologies Used**

Tableau Desktop
Calculated Fields
Filters and Parameters
Interactive Dashboards
Aggregation and Benchmarking Techniques

**Project Workflow**
